# Python AI Libraries Introduction
"""1. NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions.
2. Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library that provides data structures like DataFrames for handling structured data.
3. Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
4. Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
5. TensorFlow: An open-source library developed by Google for numerical computation and large-scale machine
6. PyTorch: An open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, known for its dynamic computation graph and ease of use. learning and deep learning applications.
7. Keras: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.
8. OpenCV: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library that provides tools for real-time image processing.
9. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A library for natural language processing that provides tools for working with human language data (text).
10. SpaCy: An open-source library for advanced natural language processing in Python, designed specifically for production use.
These libraries form the backbone of many AI applications and are widely used in the industry for various tasks such as data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing."""
